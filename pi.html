        <h3>The Raspberry Pi as a Download and File Transfer Tool</h3>
        <p>A while back, I got a raspberry pi for school to use while studying assembly, particularly ARM v6 assembly. I recently got an idea of something I could use it for, and took advantage of spring break to get to work. The idea behind the project was gain a little more experience with linux (always helpful) and to set up my raspberry pi as a home server that I could log into, download, and transfer files from. This way, I could save and download files from the raspberry pi and access them anywhere from any computer. </p>
        <p>The topics/resources needed to accomplish this, in no apparent order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setup the raspberry pi with the OS of your choice. I chose the default Raspbian.</li>
            <li><a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/accessing-raspberry-pi">Port forwarding</a> so that I could access my pi from outside my home network.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-transmission-web-interface-on-ubuntu-1204/">Transmission</a> so that I could torrent from any browser using transmissions web interface.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.techrapid.co.uk/raspberry-pi/setup-ftp-server-raspberry-pi-vsftpd/">FTP</a> so that I could transfer files.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.tecmint.com/shell-in-a-box-a-web-based-ssh-terminal-to-access-remote-linux-servers/">Shell In A Box</a> so that I could log onto my pi from any browser without the use of ssh.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once I got port forwarding and transmission set up, I was able to log into the web interface using my home ip. I simply specify the address of the torrent and watch it download to my pi.</p>

        </a> 
        <p>I may not always have a linux box around to ssh from, but with Shell In A Box I can easily log into my pi using any web browser. Here you can see that all files from transmission downloaded to my pi.</p>

        </a> 
        <p>Here I'm using filezilla to transfer the files via ftp to my laptop. It works perfectly so far, and I'm very happy with the final setup.</p>
