        <!-- ABOUT ME -->
        <p>While I&#39;ve always loved technology, the realm of programming and computer science is something I never really
        explored until I began my time at Georgia College and State University as a freshman CS major. There I took two intro Java
        courses before transferring to Georgia Tech, where I would experience both quite a shock at the shift in difficulty and an
        appreciation for what I believe to be one of the finest schools in the country. Despite the difficulty, I&#39;ve enjoyed my
        time here and I look forward to pursuing my degree further.</p>
        <p>Beyond technology and software, I&#39;ve picked up a large number of hobbies in an attempt to balance out all the time I
        spend on the computer. Biking, hiking, and kayaking are all things that I&#39;ve grown to love over the past couple years.
        Hiking especially has caught my interest, and I find myself constantly looking for affordable gear in the hopes of picking
        up backpacking sometime soon. My ultimate goal after graduation is to hike the Appalachian trail before going to work, and
        it&#39;s something I look forward to often.</p>
